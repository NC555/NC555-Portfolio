## Getting Started with Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a popular API client that makes it easy to create, share, test, and document APIs. Here's how to use the code examples in this guide:

1. **Download and install Postman** from [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. **Create a new request**:
   - Click the "+" button to create a new request
   - Set the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
   - Enter the API endpoint URL
   - Add necessary headers (Accept, Content-Type, Authorization)
   - For POST requests, add the body in the appropriate format
3. **Send the request** and view the response

Postman also allows you to create collections of requests, set environment variables for your API keys, and automate testing with scripts.

## Best Practices for API Usage

When integrating these APIs into your applications, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Respect rate limits**: Most free tiers have usage restrictions. Implement caching to reduce API calls.

2. **Secure your API keys**: Never expose your API keys in client-side code. Use environment variables or a backend proxy.

3. **Implement proper error handling**: APIs can fail or be temporarily unavailable. Always handle errors gracefully.

4. **Check licensing and attribution**: Some APIs require attribution or have usage restrictions. Review the terms before implementation.

5. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of your API consumption to avoid unexpected charges or rate limit issues.
